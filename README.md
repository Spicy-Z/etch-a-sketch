# Etch-a-Sketch
A project from The Odin Project's foundation course
Allows you to change the size of the etch-a-sketch from a range of 1-100
When your mouse hovers over the etch-a-sketch you will draw with a random set of colors beginning at a low opacity
gradually increasing the opacity from 0.1 to 1.
